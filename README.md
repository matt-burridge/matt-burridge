- 👋 Hi, I’m @matt-burridge
- 👀 I’m interested in; art - check the portfolio on www.mattburridge.com, as well as design, painting - digitally and with watercolours, gouache, acrylics and 
     oils, and about every other mark making thing I can find... typeography, iconography, graphics, animation, games - facorio and Kerbal Space Program are my jam
     right now, I had a Mastersystem growing up and sonic was my champ, the psychology and enjoyment of gameplay and loopcycles, html, javascript, webdesign, philosophy, history, animals, bugs, problem-solving and being a nerd. Blender, Krita, and Inkscape are my digital programs 
     of choice - with Linux Manjaro XFCE - a divergence of Linux Arch which is light enough to reinstall fresh in 10 minutes on modest chips, but considering 
     trying a different distro again soon. I have a 2nd generation Raspberry Pi 3 which guards my router from pesky adverts full time but has occasional projects 
     every now and then. language structure and good sentances are not my strong suites - with me often doing round-about writings to put my point accross... you 
     know like a rambler who can be basically smiled at.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a better learner, having only some C++ with unity tinkering, better frontend websiting skills and some programming languages are 
     on the agenda but I am also trying my hardest to be an illustrator as my full-time profession with coding in small furious weekends, to do geeky projects and 
     that...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ventures with a point and purpose above and beyond being part of a market and to learn derpy cool things which bring joy to 
     people who are familiar or novel to coding, spliceing art, games and coding together would be cool too, but would likely be either a minor contributor to add
     spice to a project rather than a meaty portion.
- 📫 How to reach me - just mail to matt.burridge17@gmail.com put something like github in the subject.
