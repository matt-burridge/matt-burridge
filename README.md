- 👋 Hi, I’m @matt-burridge
- 👀 I’m interested in; Seriously deep diving into learning to code, I realize that it might be handy to get a job which relies heavily on the skills and use of
coding and I also always had a bit of an affinity for tech and computers. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a better learner, I am tinkering about with using GIT to be a better team coder, I am refreshing myself on JS throughly and then branching out to Typescript and Angular, and want to make some application graphics using react.js. Past that I am hoping on really deep diving into python and starting more data visual orientated projects. Something that I have noticed when I try to learn new things especially as a grown-up is that I can intensely learn something for a few weeks and do things with it, but then I require to use what I have learned 6 months later and a little bit like speaking French all that I learned dissapears until I refresh myself again, is that something other people deal with too? I sort of pick it up quicker the subsequent times but it feels like you really need to hammer concepts and understanding a large amount to get it to stick.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects where we could learn and shape something cool.
- 📫 How to reach me - just mail to matt.burridge17@gmail.com and use the subject coding to peak my attention
