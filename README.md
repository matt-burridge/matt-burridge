- 👋 Hi, I’m @matt-burridge
- 👀 I’m interested in; learning to code, as a way to solve problems and then learn from the next wave of problems that crop up! I've an affinity for tech and computers, and figuring more about the hardware side of things interests me too. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a better learner, I am tinkering about with using GIT to be a better team coder, I am at an experiemental phase I guess, picking up things and trying to learn how it works.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn more by myself before I can contribute something of value to anothers code base.
- I do get urges to segway into side projects periodoically, whether it is with gamedev, art, 3d graphics, or solving a need and inventing a solution sometimes I try to make something. 
- 📫 How to reach me - just mail to matt.burridge17@gmail.com and put coding somewhere in the subject.
